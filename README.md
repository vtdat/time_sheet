<br>
<p>- This is a timesheet project designed and developed by ICT team. It requires user to input works that they've done on that day. User not only can review their works but also can see others' one. Managers, additionally, can give points to their employees day by day, so that, at the end of the month or year, they decide to whether incite or punish their workers. There are also other features you can explore yourself. HAVE FUN. </p><br>
